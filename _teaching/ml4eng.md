Teaching assistant for the "Machine learning for Engineers" module, in the Spring of 2021 and 2022. This module aims at providing an introduction to key concepts and algorithms in machine learning. The syllabus concentrates on supervised and unsupervised learning problems, covering topics such as information-theoretic metrics, classification, regression, stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and density estimation. It introduces fundamental concepts and algorithms by building on first principles and by using real-world examples.

Duties included: preparation of content, teaching of tutorials, assistance of students and correction of coursework.

I was nominated by students for a King's Education Award, which rewards teaching staff for their valuable contribution to students' education.
