Welcome to my personal website! I aim to share more here about my interests and research work, but it is still in construction for now. Please come back soon for more!

About
======
I am current a post-doctoral researcher with King's Communication, Learning and Information Processing (KCLIP) lab, part of King's College London Department of Engineering. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KCL, under the supervision of Prof. Osvaldo Simeone. Before that, I received my M.Eng (with Honours) and B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from CentraleSup√©lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.
