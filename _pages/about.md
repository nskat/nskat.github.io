Welcome to my personal website!

About

I am current a post-doctoral researcher with King's Communication, Learning and Information Processing (KCLIP) lab, part of King's College London Department of Engineering. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KCL, under the supervision of Prof. Osvaldo Simeone. I received my M.Eng (with Honours) and B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from CentraleSup√©lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.
